# Amazon Lex Chatbot Project

This project involves building a conversational chatbot using **Amazon Lex**, a fully managed service for creating conversational interfaces using voice and text. The chatbot is designed to understand and process user inputs through text, providing natural and engaging interactions.

## Features

- **Intents**: The chatbot is built around intents, which represent specific actions or tasks a user wants to perform. Examples include greeting users, providing help, or handling unrecognized inputs.
- **Fallback Intent**: A default intent to handle unrecognized or unclear user inputs, ensuring the conversation doesnâ€™t break.
- **Variations**: The chatbot can recognize and respond to different ways of asking the same question or making similar requests, providing a flexible and natural conversation experience.

## Key Components

### Intents
Intents are the core building blocks of the chatbot. Each intent includes:
- **Sample Utterances**: Example phrases users might say to trigger the intent.
- **Responses**: The chatbotâ€™s reply when the intent is triggered.

#### Example Intents:
1. **WelcomeIntent**: Greets users with a friendly introduction and guides them on how to proceed.
   - Sample Utterances: "Hi", "Hello", "Hey", "What's up?"
   - Response: "Hello! How can I assist you today?"

2. **FallbackIntent**: Handles unrecognized or unclear user inputs.
   - Sample Utterances: "I donâ€™t understand", "What does this mean?"
   - Response: "Iâ€™m sorry, I didnâ€™t get that. Can you please rephrase or ask something else?"

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The user interacts with the chatbot by typing text.
2. **Intent Matching**: Amazon Lex processes the input and matches it to the most relevant intent based on sample utterances and confidence scores.
3. **Response**: The chatbot responds based on the matched intent.
4. **Fallback Handling**: If the input doesnâ€™t match any intent or has a low confidence score, the FallbackIntent is triggered to guide the user back to valid interactions.

---

## What I Learned
- **Fine-Tuning Confidence Scores**: Balancing confidence scores was crucial to ensure the chatbot accurately handled user inputs without triggering fallback intents too often.
- **FallbackIntent Configuration**: Configuring the FallbackIntent was essential to handle unexpected inputs and maintain a smooth conversation flow.
- **Variations**: Adding variations to intents allowed the chatbot to recognize different phrasings of the same question, improving the user experience.

## Time Spent
This project took approximately **2-3 working hours** to complete, including configuring intents, testing, and fine-tuning.
